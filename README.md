# Computational Statistical Mechanics

This repo follows different problem sets from the textbook Statistical Mechanics: Algorithms and Computations by Werner Krauth. My goal is to familiarize myself and exercise along with graduate level physics work in QM, computational physics, prob&stats, and particle physics. From here, I hope to apply my own algorithms to real-world problems and showcase my projects and programming skills.

1) Monte Carlo example follows the article by Sukanta Deb here: https://www.ias.ac.in/article/fulltext/reso/019/08/0713-0739
